# Home Credit Default Risk – ML Case Study


#### This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline built to analyze and predict credit default risk using the Home Credit Default Risk dataset

Because of Google Colab’s limited memory, the dataset was downsized to 20,000 rows, and all merging/feature engineering steps are based on this subset.

##### Project Steps

- Data Preparation

Sampled 20,000 rows from the full dataset for memory efficiency

Merged multiple related tables (application train + others)

Removed duplicates and cleaned missing values

Cleaned special characters in column names

Feature Engineering & Encoding

Categorical encoding (One-Hot and Label Encoding where needed)

Handled imbalanced target classes using upsampling and class_weight

- Model Building

Logic Regression 

Random Forest Classifier

LightGBM Classifier


- Model Evaluation

Predictions (.predict) and probabilities (.predict_proba)

Compared against true labels (y_test)

Evaluated with ROC and precision-recall curves

- Tech Stack

Python (Google Colab)

Pandas / NumPy (data wrangling)

Scikit-learn (Random Forest, metrics)

LightGBM (gradient boosting model)

- Results

Successfully built and compared Random Forest vs. LightGBM models

Demonstrated handling of imbalanced data and the importance of probability-based evaluation

Showed practical tradeoffs between model interpretability and efficiency
